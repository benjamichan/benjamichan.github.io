          <h3 id="valueinvesting">Value Investing Feature Analysis</h3><span class="year">2024 - </span>
          <h4>Dec 2024 Update</h4>
          <p>Needed to source better quality data.  Therefore, I purchased SHARDAR SF1 Database Core Fundamentals Data (cleaned) from NASDAQ.  I used SQLlite and sqlalchemy to handle storing and quering of data.  After processing, I used Bruce Greenwald and Joel Greenblatt formulae to calculate company performance data in bulk per quarter (a mix of TTM and most recent data).  I used the Random Forest Classifer to try to predict if a ticker will be in the top percentile for future 10YR CAGR total returns accross different depths and parameters.  F1 Scores and precisions were calculated.  Then I used SHAP values to measure best features for outperformance.</p>
          <p>An example snippet is below: Classification report Class 0 is top 50% performers (I do for a range of percentiles up to top 25%).  We use all features (35 in this instance) for random forest classification.  This example, we have a maximum depth of 3.  Ideally we which to see a higher precision for top performers.</p>
          <p><img src="../../graphics/class_report_2_bucket_sf1.PNG"></p>
          <p>Using random forest feature importance (we can tune RFE to reduce number of features; in this example we have all of them).</p>
          <p><img src="../../graphics/feature_importances.PNG"></p>
          <p>Using SHAP to find direction and significance of each feature.  To do: Certain values intuitively make sense (eg. high 5 year trailing ROIC is good).  However, there are strong features that don't such as book value/share.  I need to analyze these features to see why they would be so important.</p>
          <p><img src="../../graphics/SHAP.PNG"></p>
          <p>After running a myriad of scenarios, we can pick parameters that give either the best precision (false negatives are okay in stock selection; we only want to make sure that the stocks we pick are winners and don't care as much about missing some winners) or best F1 score (best all round prediction results).  Highlighted below are the two sets of parameters that gave the best results.</p>
          <p><img src="../../graphics/precision_scores_avg.PNG"></p>
          <p>Parameters for highest average precision: aiming for top 33% forward 10 year performers; min points per terminal leaf node is 8; depth of tree for random forest is 3.  Focusing on the results with the highest average precision, we can look across time to see what the precision was for different quarters.  Precision can get above 0.7 in certain quarters, which means 70% of positives we predict end up being true postives.  In a diversified portfolio, we should see outperformance to the market.  To do: Backtest with stocks predicted to see performance vs. market.  Periods in which we know deep discounts occured (such as 2008 and 2009) should be prioritized.  We notice in periods of a sustained bull market, our precision is not as good (2011 onwards).  To do: See the most important features and average features of top predicted performers vs. bottom performers and come up with ranking algorithm.</p>
          <p><img src="../../graphics/class_report_best_top_depth_3.PNG"></p>
          <h4>Jul 2024 Update</h4>
          <p>Completed database construction using free API and data from discountingcashflows.com and calculation of EPV (using Bruce Greenwald's formulae) and first pass at feature selection using decision tree classifer.  Using gridsearch to limit tree depth to prevent overfitting.  Trying to map quintiles of features to quintiles of stock total return performance in specified time periods.  First pass results (Features are still being selected.  Some features for current output seem to be nonsensical..)</p>

          <h2 id="enterprisesoftwaresolutionsprojects">Enterprise Solutions Software Projects</h2>
          <p>Software that I have programmed to tackle certain enterprise problems (outside of my job).</p>
          <h3 id="mipscheduler">Employee Optimal Shift Scheduler</h3><span class="year">Aug 2024</span>
          <p>My fiancée worked as an HR manager at a fast food restaurant.  She told me that the manager and team manually created each week's schedule for two teams of roughly 75 employees each, which on average took up more than 12 hours each week.  So I wrote a desktop app to do it for them.</p>
          <p>It was a very interesting problem as it can be viewed as a mixed-integer constraint optimization problem, meaning that the problem is NP-hard.  Took a lot of time to reduce contraints and set up the problem to handle the myriad of contraints (see constraints in the screenshot below).  Was able to create optimal (or close to optimal) schedules that minimized costs and maximized employee satisfaction.</p>
          <p>The problem was broken into several steps as there were quite a few constraints.</p>
          <p><img src="../../graphics/constraints.PNG"></p>
          <p>Software was built with a full GUI using customTkinter.</p>
          <p>Source code was obfucated and compiled using Cython into an exe for release.</p>
          <p>Licensing feature and passcode was handled using Cryptolens.</p>

          <p>Time Series output generated for the managers for each point in time, who is staffed at what role.</p>
          <p><img src="../../graphics/schedule_output1.PNG"></p>
          <p>Software automatically generates emails to send to employees after schedule is created.</p>
          <p><img src="../../graphics/email_sample.png"></p>
          <p>Automatic texting of schedules using Twilio was being researched (but that required a budget to pay for texting via internet services and was put on hold).</p>
          
          <h2 id="machinelearningprojects">Machine Learning Personal Projects</h2>
          <p>Personal projects related to machine that I am interested in or projects I have implemented in class.</p>
          <p>Before that, however, here's my obligatory commment on machine learning and AI:</p>
          <p>Everyone these days likes to talk about AI but before I try to tackle a problem with a 1.8 trillion parameter large-language model, have I considered...</p>
          <ol>
             <li><b>Using a decision tree to help automate security selection to add to the portfolio?</b></li>
             <p>Considering that once we know what the returns and risk profile of an individual security is, we technically can list all of the securities we bought and learn features that we actually care about.  Perhaps this will make explicit the features we care about and add explainability and consistency to our investment decisions.</p>
             <li><b>Building a scraper to collect OTC trading data and using a linear regression (or if needed, gradient boosting) to find relationships between two datasets before trying more complicated non-linear relationships?</b></li>
             <p>Machine learning requires data--preferably a lot of it.  While there is a tremendous amount of data available, a lot is not easily accessable in structured finance.  However, some trading data is publically sent out by the dealers and if you collect that systematically, you'll soon find you actually have quite a bit of data!  My ML teacher once said something to effect of, “Linear regression is awesome.  Linear regression solves a lot of problems.  If the data is not linear, try to transform it to be linear.  Use Linear Regression before you try something more complicated.  Don't kill mosquitos with cannons.”</p>
             <li><b>Using fuzzy matching to tackle record linkage (ie. mapping different spellings and acronyms of company names to the same label)?</b></li>
             <p>Eg. AAL, Amercain Air Lines, American Airlines, American Airline, American Airlines Group Inc., American Airlines Group Incorporated...okay, this problem might actually require use of LLMs or word embeddings.  Perhaps a future HuggingFace project?</p>
