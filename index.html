          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <!-- <p><img src="../graphics/pug.webp" alt="pug"/></p> -->
          <p>I'm an experienced structured products finance trader with a heavy computer science and machine learning background.  I approach security analysis and credit risk managment with a focus on creating, automating, optimizing credit models and portfolio management tools.  I like to build appropriate systems and databases to aide the collection and processing of large unstructured data in order to applying statistical and machine learning techniques to drive more informed investment decisions in a field in which reliable and accessible data is hard to come by.</p>
          <p>My primary skillsets are secruity and credit analysis of structured products and their underlying collateral with an emphasis on esoteric asset-backed securities (such as aircraft ABS, MPL, subprime auto) and collateralized loan obligations.  I'm also a skilled programmer (primarily in python) with experience in full-stack development and database design.</p>
          <p>Because of my technical background, I've also been responsible for CMBS credit model construction, internal company risk and portfolio managment software development, figuring out different APIs from 3rd party data vendors, and just about everything automation related in the field of finance.</p>
          <h2>Why Focus on Technology in Finance?</h2>
          <p>One of my core beliefs is that many many finance companies do not fully take advantage many of the powerful tools avaiable today.  While there has been a lot of interest in the cutting-edge of machine learning and AI, there are a lot of low-hanging 
            fruit in the field of finance that can be tackled with thoughtful and time-tested traditional and machine-learning algorithms.</p>  
         <p>Things that I am constantly thinking about and trying to figure out on my own time:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Is there a way to efficently and accurately track current portfolio metrics such as market value, duration, weighted-average life, current average IRR, current portfolio yield, current portfolio spread, etc.?</b></li>
                <p>While it seems simple on the surface, for structured products, this requires real-time treasury curve/SOFR curve interpolation, positon-by-position cashflow updates, and setting up datafeeds from the back office.  This opens up the ability to more accurately rate hedge and credit hedge your portfolio because you can furthur stratify risk by different metrics.</p>
            <li><b>Is the current security I'm looking to purchase accretive to my portfolio yield or not?</b></li>
                <p>This requires a thorough and complete implemenation of point 1 before even such a fundamental question can be answered.</p>
            <li><b>What is the best estimate for how my security or portfolio will behave in different environments and shocks?</b></li>
                <p>This requires some measurement of portfolio performance over time (and thus requires also historical perfomrance tracking and successful completion of element 1) to run correlations, betas, and regressions against broader market benchmarks.</p>
            <li><b>How much exposure do I have to different asset classes and how much cash do I actually have on hand?</b></li>
                <p>Believe it or not, at data conferences, I learned that even well established shops still struggle with this question.</p>
            <li><b>How do I best predict how a pool of credit will perform?</b></li>
                <p>Do you have roll rate data?  How about collateral performance by FICO stratifaction?  How about re-sale value of the collateral?  Is there an easy way to get this data?  In most cases, no.  Are there alternative data sets out there?  If not, what's the best comparable to come up with a reasonable upper or lower bound?</p>
         </ol>
         <p>In general, even basic but extremely fundamental and critical information for making investment decisions requires a rather complex technical solution with multiple stages of design, implementation, and testing that many take for granted.  With these basic building blocks, I believe that portfolio management and security analysis can be more informed and scientific manner.</p>   
         <h2>What about Machine Learning/AI?</h2>
         <p>Everyone these days likes to talk about AI but before I try to tackle a problem with 1.8 trillion parameter large-language model, have I considered...</p>
         <ol>
            <li><b>Using a decision tree to help automate security selection to add to the portfolio?</b></li>
            <p>Considering that once we know what the returns and risk profile of an indivual security is, we technically can list all of the securities we bought and rigorous learn features that we actually care about.  Perhaps this will make explicit the features we care about and add explainability and consistency to our investment decisions.</p>
            <li><b>Building a scraper to collect OTC trading data and using a linear regression (or if needed, gradient boosting) to find relationships between two datasets before trying more complicated non-linear relationships?</b></li>
            <p>Machine learning requires data--preferably a lot of it.  While there is a tremendous amount of data avaiable, a lot is not easily accessable.  However, some trading data is publically blasted by the dealers and if you collect that systematically, you'll soon find you actually have quite a bit of data!  My ML teacher once said something to effect of, “Linear regression is awesome.  Linear regression solves a lot of problems.  If the data is not linear, try to transform it to be linear.  Don't kill mosquitos with cannons.”</p>
            <li><b>Using fuzzy matching to map different spellings and acronyms of company names to the same label?</b></li>
            <p>Eg. AAL, Amercain Air Lines, American Airlines, American Airline, American Airlines Group Inc., American Airlines Group Incorporated...okay, this problem might actually require use of LLMs.</p>
         </ol>
